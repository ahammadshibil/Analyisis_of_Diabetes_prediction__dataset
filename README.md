# Analyisis_of_Diabetes_prediction_among_women_in_India_dataset
This repository contains an exploratory analysis of the Pima Indians Diabetes Database and a discussion on the limitations of the dataset for predicting diabetes in the population. It also suggests improvements and recommends an alternative dataset, Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset, for a more comprehensive analysis.

The Dataset
The Pima Indians Diabetes Database contains health indicator data for a population of Pima Indian women above the age of 20. It includes features such as the number of pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin level, body mass index (BMI), diabetes pedigree function, and age.

Analysis
The analysis performed on this dataset includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modelling using logistic regression. The findings of the analysis are as follows:

The prevalence of diabetes in the dataset is significantly high, indicating a possible class imbalance problem.
Some features such as blood pressure and BMI show a strong correlation with the presence of diabetes.
The dataset does not differentiate between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, which are distinct conditions with different risk factors and management strategies.
Limitations
The dataset has several limitations:

Lack of differentiation between **Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes**: This limits the predictive power and clinical relevance of the dataset.
**High prevalence of diabetes**: This could reflect a sampling bias and may not represent the broader population.
**Early onset of diabetes: The data show a high prevalence of diabetes among younger women, which is more characteristic of Type 1 diabetes**. However, the dataset does not provide information on the type of diabetes.
Improvements
To improve the predictive power and clinical relevance of the dataset, the following improvements are recommended:

Differentiate between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes: This can be achieved by incorporating clinical data.
Include more features: Incorporating more health indicators, lifestyle factors, and genetic data could improve the predictive power of the model.
Use a more representative dataset: The Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset provides a more comprehensive view of the health indicators related to diabetes and can be used for a more in-depth analysis.
Next Steps
The next phase of this project will involve analyzing the Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset and developing a more comprehensive model for predicting diabetes.
